Privilege escalation group
Privilege escalation is the process by which a user with limited access rights gains higher privileges on a computer system or network. This is often done by hackers to gain more control over the system than they originally had. There are two main types of privilege escalation:

Vertical Privilege Escalation: Here, a user with low privileges tries to gain higher privileges, such as becoming an administrator or root. Example: A regular user tries to gain administrative privileges.

Horizontal Privilege Escalation: Here, a user tries to gain access to another account with the same privileges, but which they should not have. Example: A regular user tries to access data belonging to another user with the same privileges.

Privilege escalation often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software, poor system configuration, or misconfigurations. Prevention involves setting up proper privileges, maintaining good systems, and monitoring system activity.
